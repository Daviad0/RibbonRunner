# Ribbon Runner Mobile

Hello all of you interested hackers! This is RibbonRunner Mobile, an app made specifically for the KuriusHacks SE 2021 Hackathon! This solution directly solves the issue that prompt #2 of the Canadian Breast Cancer Society was giving us:
```
Challenge #2

Further to this objective, we want to attract new participants and
enhance the experience for the participants of our May, Mother’s Day
Walk. This traditional 5Kwalks (held in 10 cities across Canada)
moved to an app-based, virtual ‘One BillionSteps Challenge’ during
COVID. As in-person events return in 2022, we are looking for ideas to
integrate the online and ‘real walks’ to make the experience better
and attract more participants. In 2022 we are tentatively (COVID),
planning 3 in person walks (cities TBD). So, many people will not be
physically close enough to join. We will still include some form of
digital/online experience for 2022. Additionally, we are looking at the
‘event’ being rom May 1 – 8th (Mother’s Day)
```

## Testing It Out

If this sounds interesting to you, we ask you to test this out and see for yourself! Under releases, there should be an APK file released that can be downloaded to an android emulator or phone. Unfortunately due to price and time restrictions, we are not able to publish it on the iOS App Store at the moment. We apologize for any inconviences this may cause.

We do want potential experimenters to look out for a couple things though that was considered in the app making process **but disregarded due to the sake of time**:
- These APK files have no malicious content, however we have not included security measures to remove any warnings
- The app collects your location as a part of the service. We suggest using a mock location creator if you would not like to use your real device
- **YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD ARE STORED IN PLAINTEXT!** Do not at all use a password that you feel is secure.
- Data may be wiped at certain points in time in case of a potential bug identified
- Any and all users may be able to access some or all user data stored. We have a couple of precautions (server side handling, secure REPL.IT database) to stop any data breaches, but we cannot guarantee that any data is safe
- This was made by a couple of kids (and a couple of new adults); We may not be the best, but we are certainly trying

## Credits

Since this was a part of a hackathon, many resources were used that we did not have the explicit written permission to use, however under the laws of Fair Use, we believe that we are legally entitled to utilize logos and resources as long as it fits under an "educational" scope!

## Thanks \(^v^)

We hope you enjoy the experience that we pulled together as a team in the last 48 hours! If you have any feedback, please leave us a comment on DevPost. We are always looking to improve our coding skills!
